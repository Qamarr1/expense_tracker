#  Expense Tracker

A lightweight personal finance tracker built with **FastAPI** and **SQLite**, designed to help university students and young professionals easily track their income and expenses.  
The app provides a clean dashboard with charts and summaries to help users understand their spending habits and manage their budgets more effectively.

---

##  Overview

The **Expense Tracker** allows users to:
- Add, update, and delete **income** and **expense** records  
- View total income, expenses, and remaining balance  
- Visualize spending categories using **Chart.js**  
- See recent transactions on a clean and responsive dashboard  

This project was developed following the **Waterfall SDLC model**, with clear phases for requirements, design, implementation, testing, and deployment.  
It was designed to be realistic, maintainable, and scalable for future use by university students or young professionals.

##Initialize the Database

No manual SQL setup is needed!
When you first run the app, it automatically creates the database file expense.db and adds default categories like ‚ÄúFood‚Äù, ‚ÄúTransport‚Äù, etc.

If you delete expense.db, the app will recreate it on startup.

You can verify by checking that a file named expense.db appears in your project directory after the first run.

 Run the Application

Start the FastAPI server:

uvicorn main:app --reload


### If your code is in a folder (e.g. /app/main.py), then:

--uvicorn app.main:app --reload


### When it starts successfully, you‚Äôll see:
--Application startup complete.
